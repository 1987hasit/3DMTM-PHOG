Three Dimensional Motion Trail Model for Gesture Recognition.
 
This code is developed for imporovement of the work: Gesture Recognition Using Depth Images.

Dataset: MSR Action3D dataset (organized dataset can be downloaded at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5dmdxc2t51eu8dr/dataset.rar?dl=0 )

1) PHOG is performed on 3D-MTM.
2) PCA is performed after PHOG feature extraction before SVM
3) Better results are obtained
